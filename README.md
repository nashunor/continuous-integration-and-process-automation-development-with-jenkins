## Abstract
The automotive industry is changing rapidly and with it the onboard systems, including embedded software on Electronic Control Units (ECU), resulting in an influx of system complexity. This means ECUs must function properly and adhere to the Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) scheme. System complexity and proper functionality yields a significantly more dynamic sensor and software. To keep up with proper integration and testing of new functionalities, these processes must be automated. The concept of automating such processes seems simple, however, the optimization, maintenance, inner workings, and component communication is challenging to synthesize. After the automation process has been developed, the metrics and data of the current functioning architecture must be considered and monitored so that the automation process executes the job in a viable amount of time. The aim of this thesis is to build on an existing automated pipeline and develop the most optimized continuous integration and testing process within the constraints of the technology available.
